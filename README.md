How much water is enough for your dog
===

## Introduction

Itâ€™s hard to measure how much your dog or cat drink water a day. However, the daily water intake may signal a healthy problem.
This device is my own design for recording the consumption of water from my dog each day and every 8hr. And you can trace the water level of the water bowl from your connected device, moreover, if the level is too low, the chip under the bowl will remind you to fill it.

This IoT device is get much help from https://randomnerdtutorials.com/
There are many material about chip design using ESP32. Thanks a lot for them.
